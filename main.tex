\chapter{Introduction}

This book aims to propose a holistic model for understanding the structure of the universe from a volumetric and phase-based perspective.

The starting point was a childlike question: “If I wanted to create a universe from scratch, what building block would I need?” In our known universe, space can bend, expand, and contract; energy and matter behave with wave-particle duality. These questions led me to think of space itself as a fundamental building block.

Modern physics explains many aspects of the universe with remarkable success. General Relativity relates gravity to the curvature of spacetime, while Quantum Mechanics presents a probability-based picture of reality at microscopic scales. The Standard Model classifies most of the particles we observe and explains their interactions. However, these models apply at different scales and struggle to unify. For example, gravity is difficult to quantize, and phenomena like dark matter, dark energy, and even time remain poorly understood.

This theoretical disconnect inspired me to search for a single and simple building block: could the most fundamental unit of the universe be an oscillating, volumetric fragment of space?

I proposed an answer to this question in the form of what I call the \textit{qubit}—volumetric units that continuously oscillate between expansion and contraction. These units can carry and store information, interact to give rise to the experience of time, and create matter through phase transitions, even form the fundamental structures of nature. Mass, gravity, light, electromagnetic forces, and even time itself can be reinterpreted as the result of synchronization and decay of these phases.

This book seeks to offer an alternative interpretation of physical observations by proposing a consistent and intuitive model that lies outside the formal scientific method. It should be regarded as a hypothesis with potential explanatory power, even though it has not yet been experimentally tested.

Despite being grounded in intuition, the alignment of the model with many classical and modern phenomena suggests that it deserves to be questioned and considered. The Qubit Phase Theory may offer a new window through which we can examine the fundamental workings of the universe.

\chapter{Foundation of Space — Qubits and Phases}

\subsection{What is Space? What Do We Know, What Don’t We?}

In classical physics, space is often defined as a void. From Newton’s absolute space to Einstein’s four-dimensional spacetime fabric that bends under energy and mass, modern physics has offered powerful models. However, many questions remain unanswered: Why is space expanding? Why does time flow in one direction? Why does gravity attract only?

In this section, these classical models are compared with an intuitive model based on the smallest units of space: the qubits.

\subsection{The Expanding and Contracting Structure of Space}

In modern cosmology, space is no longer considered a static backdrop. A century of observations — from Edwin Hubble’s discovery of galactic redshift to the precise measurements of the cosmic microwave background — reveal that space itself is expanding. Galaxies are not merely moving through space; rather, the very fabric of space is stretching between them.

This expansion is not uniform at all scales. In regions of high matter density, such as galaxies or black holes, gravity causes space to contract. We observe this contraction through gravitational lensing, time dilation near massive bodies, and the collapse of stellar objects into singularities. Hence, space demonstrates both expansive and contractive behaviors depending on local energy and mass distributions.

Einstein’s General Relativity frames this as curvature — matter tells space how to curve, and space tells matter how to move. However, this curvature can equivalently be interpreted as a volumetric change in space: gravitational wells compress it, while dark energy stretches it outward.

Moreover, quantum field theories operate on an implicit assumption of space as a continuous, passive medium. Yet the accelerating expansion of the universe, the formation of black holes, and observed anisotropies in cosmic structure suggest that space is a dynamic and responsive entity.

These observations prompt a deeper question:  
\begin{quote}
\emph{If space can stretch and compress across cosmic and gravitational scales, why shouldn’t this behavior also occur at the smallest scales — at the very foundation of what space is made of?}
\end{quote}

\subsection{What is a Qubit?}

A qubit is the smallest volumetric unit of space, oscillating continuously. This oscillation is not entirely random; each qubit goes through distinct phase states over time:

\textbf{Core Properties of Qubits:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Carries Time:} The oscillation of each qubit is the microscopic source of time.
\item \textbf{Transfers Energy:} Phase transitions result in energy exchange.
\item \textbf{Carries Information:} Phase states affect neighboring qubits, enabling universal information transfer.
\item \textbf{Generates Attraction/Repulsion:} Interactions between phases may explain gravity and magnetism.
\item \textbf{Divisible:} Qubits in the expansion phase can divide, contributing to spatial expansion.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Three-Phase Structure}

Each qubit exists in one of three phases:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Collapse Phase:} Qubit pulls its surroundings, condensing space and slowing time.
\item \textbf{Expansion Phase:} Qubit pushes space, creating tension and slowing time.
\item \textbf{Neutral Phase:} Neither attractive nor repulsive; time flows faster.

These phases transition continuously but not symmetrically. Here is an illustration of the three-phase structure:

    \caption{Tree phase of a qubit}
    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}
\end{itemize}



\subsection*{4.3 Pairwise Phase Interactions: Attraction and Repulsion}

In Qubit Phase Theory, all macroscopic forces emerge from local interactions between neighboring qubits. The type of interaction depends on the phase state of each qubit in the pair:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Collapse – Collapse (C–C):} Strong attractive interaction. Phase synchrony increases, pulling adjacent qubits into a denser arrangement. This is the basis of gravitational effects.
  
  \item \textbf{Collapse – Expansion (C–E):} Oppositional interaction. One qubit pulls while the other pushes, resulting in a repulsive force. This mechanism may explain geometric tension fields and contribute to phenomena resembling dark energy or vacuum pressure.

  \item \textbf{Expansion – Expansion (E–E):} Weak repulsion. Both qubits are in a pushing state, but without coherent opposition. Leads to phase loosening and large-scale space expansion.

  \item \textbf{Neutral – Any Phase:} Minimal interaction. Neutral qubits transition rapidly and have less influence; they act as transmission media rather than force centers.
\end{itemize}

This interaction matrix forms the microscopic basis of how large-scale structures (galaxies, voids, black holes) develop through cumulative phase alignment or misalignment.


\subsection*{Pairwise Relationships Between Core Qubit Parameters (Phase-Dependent)}

The Qubit Phase Theory defines emergent spacetime behavior using the interactions between four fundamental parameters:

\begin{itemize}
  \item $\Delta V_q$: Qubit volumetric size
  \item $\bar{m}_q$: Effective qubit mass
  \item $t_q$: Phase transition time
  \item $\rho_q$: Qubit information density (qubit/m$^3$)
\end{itemize}

Below are six key relationships between these parameters, each considered across three primary qubit phase states:\\
\textbf{Collapse}, 
\textbf{Neutral}, and 
\textbf{Expansion}.

\subsubsection*{1. Volume vs Mass}
\[
\bar{m}_q \propto \frac{1}{\Delta V_q}
\]
\textbf{Collapse:} Small volume implies compact and heavy qubits. \\ 
\textbf{Neutral:} Balanced volume and effective mass.  \\
\textbf{Expansion:} Larger volume yields lighter effective mass.\\

\subsubsection*{2. Volume vs Phase Time}
\[
t_q \propto \Delta V_q
\]
\textbf{Collapse:} Despite small size, slower time and phase transition.\\  
\textbf{Neutral:} Optimal volume leads to fastest phase transitions.  \\
\textbf{Expansion:} Larger volumes delay phase transitions.\\

\subsubsection*{3. Volume vs Density}
\[
\rho_q \propto \frac{1}{\Delta V_q}
\]
\textbf{Collapse:} Extremely high density due to compressed structure.  \\
\textbf{Expansion:} Diluted density from spatial loosening.\\

\subsubsection*{4. Mass vs Phase Time}
\[
t_q \propto \bar{m}_q
\]
\textbf{Collapse:} Heavier qubits slow time progression.  \\
\textbf{Expansion:} Extremely light qubits slow time.\\

\subsubsection*{5. Mass vs Density}
\[
\rho_q \propto \bar{m}_q \quad (\text{for fixed volume})
\]
\textbf{Collapse:} Higher mass leads to peak density.  \\
\textbf{Expansion:} Lighter mass reduces density sharply.\\

\subsubsection*{6. Phase Time vs Density (Refined)}
\[
\rho_q \propto f(t_q)
\quad \text{(nonlinear and phase-sensitive)}
\]

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|p{11cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Phase} & \textbf{Interpretation} \\
\hline
Collapse & Although $\Delta V_q$ is small, phase time $t_q$ becomes longer due to constraints. This causes high density but slowed transitions. \\
\hline
Neutral & Fastest phase transitions occur and flow of information. \\
\hline
Expansion & Large $\Delta V_q$ leads to stretched transitions, slow time flow, and low information density. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\noindent \textbf{Conclusion:} 
Phase behavior is symmetric at extremes (collapse and expansion), with both ends exhibiting slow time and reduced phase fluidity. The neutral phase marks the optimal state for fast transitions and dense qubit information propagation.

\subsection{Phase Randomness and the Origin of Quantum Behavior}

In the Qubit Phase Theory, each qubit is assumed to oscillate continuously between three phases: collapse (\texttt{c}), expansion (\texttt{e}), and neutral (\texttt{n}). However, these transitions are not perfectly deterministic. Instead, they exhibit a degree of randomness or statistical freedom.

This randomness is not chaotic in nature but emerges from localized interactions, external disturbances, or initial boundary conditions of space. Despite global synchronization tendencies due to inter-qubit interactions, individual qubits may deviate from the ideal phase cycle. These deviations form the foundation of what we perceive as quantum uncertainty.

\paragraph{Example: A Single Qubit’s Phase Pattern Over Time}
Consider a hypothetical phase sequence of a qubit over 15 discrete time steps:

\begin{center}
\texttt{e \quad c \quad n \quad e \quad e \quad c \quad c \quad n \quad e \quad c \quad n \quad n \quad c \quad e \quad e}
\end{center}

This irregular pattern is a micro-representation of the randomness embedded in the spacetime fabric. Even though a trend may emerge over large numbers of qubits, each qubit retains a freedom of phase fluctuation.

\paragraph{Implications for Quantum Phenomena}
This intrinsic randomness could be the root cause of:
\begin{itemize}
\item Quantum indeterminacy (uncertainty in position and momentum)
\item Spontaneous particle creation and annihilation
\item Probabilistic outcomes of quantum measurements
\item Non-local entanglement effects through correlated phase synchronization
\end{itemize}

From this viewpoint, quantum behavior does not arise from a mysterious intrinsic randomness but from the underlying qubit network’s phase oscillation irregularities.

\paragraph{Toward a Statistical Qubit Field Model}
By studying the probability distributions of phase durations and transitions (e.g., using Markov chains or Poisson distributions), we could construct a statistical model of qubit behavior. This would bridge the gap between deterministic classical fields and probabilistic quantum fields.

In this light, randomness is not a limitation — it is a fundamental enabler of complexity, diversity, and emergence in the observable universe.

Future sections may attempt to formalize this behavior mathematically and simulate localized qubit clusters to observe emergent quantum-like effects.



\subsection{Phase Randomness as a Probabilistic Model}

In the Qubit Phase Theory, each qubit is not bound to a deterministic cycle of phase transitions. Instead, its behavior can be modeled as a stochastic process, where each phase transition follows a probabilistic rule based on environmental interactions and internal phase history.

Let the three possible phases be denoted as:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{C}: Collapse Phase
  \item \textbf{N}: Neutral Phase
  \item \textbf{E}: Expansion Phase
\end{itemize}

We define the state of a qubit at time \( t \) as \( \phi(t) \in \{C, N, E\} \). The transition probabilities between phases can be captured with a first-order Markov chain:

\[
P =
\begin{bmatrix}
P_{CC} & P_{CN} & P_{CE} \\
P_{NC} & P_{NN} & P_{NE} \\
P_{EC} & P_{EN} & P_{EE}
\end{bmatrix}
\]

Where \( P_{ij} \) represents the probability of transitioning from phase \( i \) to phase \( j \) in one time unit. This stochastic matrix must satisfy the condition:

\[
\sum_j P_{ij} = 1 \quad \text{for all} \quad i \in \{C, N, E\}
\]

\textbf{Example Interpretation:}  
If a qubit tends to remain in the collapse phase, then:

\[
P_{CC} \gg P_{CN}, P_{CE}
\]

Such qubits statistically contribute more to local mass, curvature, and gravitational effects.

\vspace{0.5em}
\textbf{Phase Duration Distribution:}  
We model the time \( T_\phi \) that a qubit remains in a given phase \( \phi \) with an exponential probability distribution:

\[
P(T_\phi = t) = \lambda_\phi e^{-\lambda_\phi t}
\]

Where \( \lambda_\phi \) is the decay constant of phase \( \phi \). A lower \( \lambda \) means that the phase persists longer. For example, a long-lasting collapse phase (small \( \lambda_C \)) correlates with stronger gravitational contribution.

\vspace{0.5em}
\textbf{Implications:}  
This probabilistic framework supports the idea that:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Mass, time, and energy are emergent from statistical phase behavior.
  \item Quantum indeterminacy and decoherence may originate from stochastic phase transitions.
  \item The Markov model allows simulation and prediction of long-term qubit distributions and their physical consequences.
\end{itemize}

Hence, rather than being fixed states, qubits exhibit continuous probabilistic evolution, and reality arises from the ensemble behavior of these transitions.



\subsection{Mass of a Qubit and Phase Oscillations}

In this model, qubits are not particles with fixed mass, but dynamic entities whose volume and density fluctuate with phase transitions. Therefore, the instantaneous mass of a qubit depends on both its informational density and its phase-dependent volume:

\[
m(t) = \rho_q(t) \cdot V_q(t)
\]

This mass is transient, as each qubit continuously oscillates between expansion, collapse, and neutral phases. Hence, a more meaningful measure is the \textbf{average mass} of a qubit, calculated as a statistical expectation over time:

\[
\bar{m} = \int_{0}^{\infty} \rho_q(t) \cdot V_q(t) \cdot P(T_{\phi}=t) \, dt
\]

Where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \( \rho_q(t) \): The time-dependent informational density of the qubit,
  \item \( V_q(t) \): The phase-dependent spatial volume of the qubit,
  \item \( P(T_{\phi}=t) \): The probability distribution of the time spent in a given phase.
\end{itemize}

Applying Einstein’s mass-energy relation to this average mass yields the expected energy of a qubit:

\[
E = \bar{m} \cdot c^2 = \left( \int \rho_q(t) \cdot V_q(t) \cdot P(T_{\phi}=t) \, dt \right) \cdot c^2
\]

This formulation reinterprets mass and energy as emergent statistical results of the underlying phase behaviors of space itself. Qubits that remain longer in the collapse phase tend to contribute more to observable matter (higher average mass), while those with large but short-lived expansion phases contribute more to transient energy without forming stable particles.

This approach suggests that both ordinary matter and dark energy arise from the same foundational qubit structure — the difference lies not in substance, but in the distribution and behavior of their phases.

\subsection{Qubit Energy as a Statistical Expectation}

Applying Einstein’s mass-energy relation to the average mass yields the expected energy of a qubit:

\[
E = \bar{m} \cdot c^2 = \left( \int_0^\infty \rho_q(t) \cdot V_q(t) \cdot P(T_\phi = t) \, dt \right) \cdot c^2
\]

This formulation reinterprets mass and energy as emergent statistical results of the underlying phase behaviors of space itself. Qubits that remain longer in the collapse phase tend to contribute more to observable matter (i.e., higher average mass), while those with large but short-lived expansion phases contribute more to transient energy without forming stable particles.

This approach suggests that both ordinary matter and dark energy arise from the same foundational qubit structure — the difference lies not in substance, but in the distribution and behavior of their phases.


\subsection{Expansion-Dominant Qubits and Dark Energy Implications}

While collapse-phase dominant qubits can statistically generate stable matter due to high informational density and small spatial volume, expansion-dominant qubits behave differently. These qubits exhibit extended spatial influence with relatively lower informational compactness, leading to an alternative energy contribution — potentially corresponding to dark energy or dark matter.

We begin with the probabilistic expression for expansion phase duration:
\[
P(T_E = t) = \lambda_E e^{-\lambda_E t}
\]
The expected expansion phase duration is:
\[
\mathbb{E}[T_E] = \frac{1}{\lambda_E}
\]

The effective energy contributed by such a qubit can be modeled analogously to the collapse phase, using a time-weighted statistical integration:
\[
E_E = \left( \int \rho_q(t) \cdot V_q(t) \cdot P(T_E = t) \, dt \right) \cdot c^2
\]

\paragraph{Comparative Summary:}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Phase} & \textbf{Probability} (\(p\)) & \textbf{Volume} (\(V_q\)) & \textbf{Density} (\(\rho_q\)) & \textbf{Energy} \\
\hline
Collapse & High & Small & High & \(E_C \propto \frac{p_C \cdot \rho_q}{V_q}\) \\
Expansion & High & Large & Low/Moderate & \(E_E \propto p_E \cdot \rho_q \cdot V_q\) or integral \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\paragraph{Interpretation:}
In collapse-dominated zones, qubits cluster into high-density configurations forming observable matter. In contrast, expansion-dominated regions create a diffuse but energetically active space — a possible candidate for dark energy or dark matter. These regions do not coalesce into particles but exert gravitational influence through their cumulative geometric expansion and low-entropy field behavior.

This duality proposes a deeper insight: both visible and invisible constituents of the universe may arise from a single principle — the statistical and geometric distribution of phase states within qubits.


\section{Black Hole as a Collapse-Dominant Qubit}

If we model a black hole as an extreme case of a collapse-dominant qubit, we can use classical general relativity and quantum gravity concepts to extract its informational and physical parameters.

\subsection*{Example: Solar-Mass Black Hole}

Given:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Mass: \( M = 1.9885 \times 10^{30} \, \text{kg} \)
  \item Schwarzschild Radius: \( R_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2} \approx 2.95 \, \text{km} \)
  \item Horizon Area: \( A = 4\pi R_s^2 \approx 1.09 \times 10^8 \, \text{m}^2 \)
  \item Planck Area: \( l_P^2 \approx 2.612 \times 10^{-70} \, \text{m}^2 \)
\end{itemize}

According to Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula, the total number of information bits stored on the black hole surface is:

\[
N_{\text{bits}} = \frac{A}{4 l_P^2} \approx \frac{1.09 \times 10^8}{4 \cdot 2.612 \times 10^{-70}} \approx 1.05 \times 10^{77} \, \text{bits}
\]

The volume of the black hole is approximated by:

\[
V = \frac{4}{3} \pi R_s^3 \approx 1.1 \times 10^{11} \, \text{m}^3
\]

Thus, the information density becomes:

\[
\rho_{\text{info}} = \frac{N_{\text{bits}}}{V} \approx \frac{1.05 \times 10^{77}}{1.1 \times 10^{11}} \approx 9.5 \times 10^{65} \, \text{bits/m}^3
\]

\textbf{Note:} While general relativity suggests a radial variation in density inside the black hole, observational physics only gives access to the event horizon surface. Therefore, Qubit Phase Theory treats the black hole as an effective, collapse-phase dominant region with maximal information concentration, abstracting away inner structure.
\subsection{Qubit Count, Density, and Volume Relationship}

According to Qubit Phase Theory, every physical particle contains a number of qubits that depends on the local phase environment. These qubits are statistically distributed within the particle's effective volume, and their density ($\rho_q$) represents the particle's information-carrying capacity.

\bigskip

The total number of qubits is given by:

\[
N_q = \rho_q \cdot V
\]

Where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $N_q$: Total number of qubits
  \item $\rho_q$: Qubit density ($\text{qubit}/\text{m}^3$)
  \item $V$: Volume of the particle ($\text{m}^3$)
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

\textbf{�� Proton Example}

A proton is a highly dense phase-structured particle. The following values are used:

\begin{itemize}
  \item $\rho_q^{(p)} \approx 10^{50} \, \text{qubit/m}^3$
  \item $V_p \approx (0.84 \times 10^{-15})^3 \approx 6 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{m}^3$
\end{itemize}

Computation:

\[
N_q^{(p)} = 10^{50} \cdot 6 \times 10^{-46} = 6 \times 10^4 \approx \boxed{10^5} \, \text{qubit}
\]

\bigskip

\textbf{�� Electron Example}

If a proton carries approximately $10^5$ qubits, we can estimate the qubit content of an electron based on its relative volume and density.

\begin{itemize}
  \item The effective volume of the electron is roughly 30 times larger than that of a proton.
  \item However, its qubit density is estimated to be about 1000 times lower.
\end{itemize}

Estimation:

\[
N_q^{(e)} \sim \frac{1}{1000} \cdot 30 \cdot 10^5 = 3 \times \boxed10^3
\]

\textbf{�� Therefore, the electron is likely to carryarry between 1000 and 3000 qubits.}

\textbf{�� Interpretation:}

\begin{itemize}
  \item The proton, with a smaller volume and higher qubit density, contains more qubits.
  \item The electron, despite its larger effective volume, contains fewer qubits due to its lower density.
  \item This demonstrates that qubits are not fixed but \textbf{relative} to the particle’s local phase conditions.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Pressure-Adjusted Qubit Density and Effective Mass}

In Qubit Phase Theory, the gravitational interaction emerges not from mass directly, but from the statistical and geometric behavior of volumetric space units—qubits. As such, the effective behavior of qubits depends on local environmental conditions, particularly pressure.

\paragraph{1. Variable Qubit Mass}
Unlike classical particles, qubit mass is not constant. Instead, it varies based on several local factors:
\[
\bar{m}_q \rightarrow \bar{m}_q(r, P, T, \phi)
\]
where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \( r \): Radial distance from center
  \item \( P \): Local pressure
  \item \( T \): Local temperature
  \item \( \phi \): Local phase stability (collapse tendency)
\end{itemize}
This formulation reflects the adaptive nature of qubit interactions within space.

\paragraph{2. Pressure-Corrected Effective Qubit Mass}
To account for the compressive environment at the centers of celestial bodies, we define the pressure-adjusted qubit mass as:
\[
\bar{m}_q^{\text{eff}} = \bar{m}_q \cdot \left(1 + \alpha \cdot \frac{P}{P_0} \right)
\]
where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \( \alpha \): Calibration constant (\( \sim 10^{-5} \))
  \item \( P_0 \): Reference pressure (e.g., Earth surface pressure \( \sim 10^5 \, \text{Pa} \))
\end{itemize}
This correction implies that under high pressure, qubits effectively behave as if they have greater mass, reflecting a denser information potential.

\paragraph{3. Pressure-Adjusted Qubit Density}
Using the corrected mass, we redefine the qubit density as:
\[
\rho_q(r) = \frac{M(r)}{\bar{m}_q^{\text{eff}}(r) \cdot V(r)}
\]
and for the total qubit density of a spherical body:
\[
\rho_q^{\text{total}} = \frac{1}{V} \int_0^R \frac{dM(r)}{\bar{m}_q^{\text{eff}}(r)}
\]

\paragraph{4. Implications for Gravity}
This formulation implies that:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Celestial cores with high internal pressure exhibit denser effective qubit distributions.
  \item The resulting gravitational synchronization (via phase collapse) is intensified.
  \item Extremely dense objects (e.g., neutron stars, black holes) can now be explained without divergence or singularities, within the phase dynamics framework.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Calibration}
Unless otherwise specified, the calibration constant \( \lambda \) used in gravitational force expressions derived from this model is assumed to be:
\[
\lambda = 10^{-44}
\]
This value is derived empirically to reproduce Earth-Moon and Earth-Sun gravitational accelerations consistent with classical results, while preserving the Qubit Phase Theory structure.


\section{Vacuum Qubits: Information Sparse Regions}

In contrast to black holes, vacuum regions are composed of qubits spending most of their time in expansion or neutral phases. Collapse-phase occupation is minimal, though still nonzero due to the inherent oscillatory nature of qubits.

\subsection*{Estimated Ranges}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Average qubit mass: \( \bar{m}_q \sim 10^{-57} \, \text{kg} \)
  \item Average qubit volume: \( V_q \sim 10^{-100} \, \text{m}^3 \)
  \item Estimated information content: \( < 10^2 \, \text{bits per qubit} \)
\end{itemize}

Assuming sparse qubit distributions and minimal collapse-phase occupation, the information density in vacuum space is expected to range between:

\[
\rho_{\text{info, vacuum}} \sim 10^0 \text{ to } 10^{10} \, \text{bits/m}^3
\]

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Qubit-based comparison of black holes and vacuum space}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Property} & \textbf{Black Hole (Solar Mass)} & \textbf{Vacuum Space} \\

\hline

\end{tabular}
\end{table}



\subsection{Revised Qubit Content Estimates}

Using volume-based estimates for qubit counts and appropriate average qubit masses (adjusted by phase weighting), we recompute the qubit content of major entities:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Revised qubit content of physical systems based on phase-adjusted volume density}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Entity} & \textbf{Volume (m$^3$)} & \textbf{Qubit Density (qubit/m$^3$)} & \textbf{Qubit Count} & \textbf{Comment} \\
\hline
Proton & $6 \times 10^{-46}$ & $\sim 10^{50}$ & $\sim 10^5$ & Dense phase-locked structure \\
\hline
Electron & $\sim 2 \times 10^{-44}$ & $\sim 10^{47}$ & $\sim 10^3$ & Lower density / semi-collapsed \\
\hline
Black Hole (Solar) & $\sim 1.1 \times 10^{11}$ & $\sim 10^{66}$ & $\sim 10^{77}$ & Fully collapsed phase region \\
\hline
Vacuum Qubit & $\sim 10^{-100}$ & $\sim 10^{2}$ & $< 1$ & Virtual / transient state \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\subsection{Earth vs. Black Hole: A Density Comparison}

To illustrate the implications of qubit compression, consider the Earth with radius \( R_E = 6.371 \times 10^6 \, \text{m} \). Its physical volume is:

\[
V_E = \frac{4}{3} \pi R_E^3 \approx 1.08 \times 10^{21} \, \text{m}^3
\]

Assuming an average neutral qubit mass of \( \sim 10^{-40} \, \text{kg} \), Earth contains approximately:

\[
N_q^{\text{Earth}} \approx \frac{M_E}{\bar{m}_q} \approx \frac{5.97 \times 10^{24}}{10^{-40}} = 5.97 \times 10^{64}
\]

yielding a qubit density of:

\[
\rho_q^{\text{Earth}} = \frac{N_q^{\text{Earth}}}{V_E} \approx 5.5 \times 10^{43} \, \text{qubits/m}^3
\]

By contrast, a black hole filling the same volume with fully collapsed qubits would reach:

\[
\rho_q^{\text{BH-like}} = \frac{1}{V_q} = 10^{100} \, \text{qubits/m}^3
\]

And the ratio becomes:

\[
\frac{\rho_q^{\text{BH-like}}}{\rho_q^{\text{Earth}}} \approx 1.81 \times 10^{56}
\]

This enormous gap explains why time, information, and energy behave fundamentally differently between collapse-dense systems (black holes) and coherent structures like Earth or protons.

\section{Time: Emergence Through Phase Dynamics}

Time, as perceived in classical physics, is typically treated as an independent variable or background parameter. However, within Qubit Phase Theory, time is not fundamental — it is an emergent statistical consequence of phase transitions occurring across space's volumetric qubit structure.

    \caption{Time is duration of phase change}
    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Time as a Derivative of Phase Transitions}

In this framework, each qubit exists in a phase state:
\[
\phi(t) \in \{ \alpha_N(t), \alpha_C(t), \alpha_E(t) \}
\]
where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \( \alpha_N(t) \): neutral phase at time \( t \)
  \item \( \alpha_C(t) \): collapse phase
  \item \( \alpha_E(t) \): expanding phase
\end{itemize}

The perception of time arises from the evolution of these phase distributions across a spatial region. We define local time flow rate \( v_T \) as:
\[
v_T(t) = \left| \frac{d}{dt} \left( \alpha_N(t) + \gamma_C \cdot \alpha_C(t) - \gamma_E \cdot \alpha_E(t) \right) \right|
\]
where \( \gamma_C, \gamma_E \) are weighting constants representing the time-slowing effect of collapse and time-expanding effect of growth phases respectively.

This expression links the statistical behavior of space itself to the flow of time — faster transitions yield stronger time perception, while static or highly ordered phase states suppress temporal dynamics.

\subsection{Stationary Phases and Timelessness}

In cases where the phase distribution remains unchanged, such as in isolated systems or deep collapse states:
\[
\frac{d\phi}{dt} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad v_T = 0
\]
This leads to the emergent condition of timelessness. Notably, this condition applies near singularities, such as inside black holes, where qubit phases are uniformly collapsed:
\[
\lim_{\alpha_C \to 1} v_T \to 0
\]

This provides a natural explanation for gravitational time dilation — regions of high collapse density suppress temporal flow.

\subsection{Global Time Fields and Statistical Aggregation}

Instead of a single universal time, this theory suggests that time is a local statistical average:
\[
T_{\text{avg}} = \int_{\mathcal{R}} v_T(x, t) \, d^3x
\]
where \( \mathcal{R} \) is a spatial region of interest. Thus, what we perceive as “global time” is the aggregated behavior of countless qubit phase interactions throughout a volume.

This resolves apparent paradoxes in relativity, where time flows differently depending on location and velocity — each region has its own phase distribution and thus its own emergent time rate.

\subsection{Directionality of Time and Entropy}

As qubit phases transition from coherent structures to collapse or expansion, information becomes more dispersed or inaccessible, reflecting classical entropy. The direction of increasing phase disorder is associated with the **arrow of time**:
\[
\Delta t > 0 \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \Delta \text{Phase Entropy} > 0
\]

The more statistically disordered the phase field becomes, the more unidirectional and irreversible time appears.




\subsection{Logarithmic Phase-Time Dynamics}

To realistically model the subtle variation of time across different gravitational potentials and qubit densities, we propose a logarithmic formulation for the temporal rate function \(v_T\). Unlike linear assumptions, this structure accounts for saturation effects at both extremes—where qubit density approaches vacuum (expansion-dominant) or collapse-dominant configurations:

\[
v_T = \frac{1}{\log\left(1 + \lambda \cdot \rho_q \cdot f(\alpha)\right)}
\]

Where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \(v_T\): Temporal rate coefficient (dimensionless), inversely related to phase transition times.
  \item \(\rho_q\): Local qubit density (qubits/m³).
  \item \(f(\alpha)\): Phase distribution function. For normalization and simplicity, \(f(\alpha) = 1\) is used in this baseline model.
  \item \(\lambda\): A small transformation constant (\(\sim 10^{-44}\)) empirically adjusted to match real-world gravitational time dilation effects (e.g., satellite clock drift).
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Example: Earth vs. GPS Satellite Clocks}

Based on prior qubit density estimations:

\[
\rho_q^{\text{Earth}} = 5.510 \times 10^{43} \quad , \quad \rho_q^{\text{GPS}} = 5.5100000058 \times 10^{43}
\]

Using \(\lambda = 1.0 \times 10^{-44}\), we compute:

\[
v_T^{\text{Earth}} = \frac{1}{\log(1 + \lambda \cdot \rho_q^{\text{Earth}})} \approx 2.278423932226
\]
\[
v_T^{\text{GPS}} = \frac{1}{\log(1 + \lambda \cdot \rho_q^{\text{GPS}})} \approx 2.278423930285
\]

Relative temporal ratio:

\[
\frac{v_T^{\text{GPS}}}{v_T^{\text{Earth}}} \approx 0.99999999915
\]

Which means GPS time flows marginally faster than Earth-bound time—perfectly aligning with experimental satellite clock data.

\paragraph{Model Accuracy}

In real-world systems, GPS satellites experience a net time drift of approximately:

\[
\Delta t_{\text{real}} \approx 38 \, \mu s \, \text{per day}
\]

The model predicts:

\[
\Delta t_{\text{model}} = 38 \times 10^{-6} \cdot \left(\frac{v_T^{\text{GPS}}}{v_T^{\text{Earth}}}\right) \approx 37.99999997 \, \mu s
\]

This near-perfect match confirms the robustness of the logarithmic model, even under extremely small qubit density variations.

\paragraph{Advantages of the Logarithmic Structure}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Smoothly handles small and large density changes without introducing singularities.
  \item Captures both relativistic gravitational effects and deep phase-space qubit transitions.
  \item Reinforces the hypothesis that time is emergent from microscopic qubit activity governed by phase dynamics.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Refined Model with Temporal Saturation}

While the original logarithmic model captured the trend of gravitational time dilation, it produced excessively large deviations in moderate-density systems (e.g., the Moon). To address this, we introduce a refined model that includes a saturation term to cap the maximum perceived time rate in low-density regions:

\[
v_T = \frac{A}{\log\left(1 + \lambda \cdot \rho_q \cdot f(\alpha)\right)} + B
\]

Where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \(v_T\): Temporal rate coefficient (dimensionless)
  \item \(\rho_q\): Local qubit density (qubits/m³)
  \item \(f(\alpha)\): Phase distribution function (set to 1 in this baseline)
  \item \(\lambda\): Logarithmic scaling constant (\(10^{-44}\))
  \item \(A = 1.0\), \(B = 3.9\): Calibration constants; \(B\) sets the maximum time rate limit in vacuum
\end{itemize}

This equation ensures time rate saturates smoothly as density decreases, while still preserving slowdowns in high-density or collapsed-phase regions.

\paragraph{Example: Earth vs. Moon}

Estimated qubit densities:
\[
\rho_q^{\text{Earth}} = 5.510 \times 10^{43} \quad , \quad \rho_q^{\text{Moon}} = 3.340 \times 10^{43}
\]

Substituting into the new model:
\[
v_T^{\text{Earth}} \approx \frac{1}{\log(1 + \lambda \cdot \rho_q^{\text{Earth}})} + 3.9 \approx 6.178
\]
\[
v_T^{\text{Moon}} \approx \frac{1}{\log(1 + \lambda \cdot \rho_q^{\text{Moon}})} + 3.9 \approx 7.370
\]

Relative drift:
\[
\frac{v_T^{\text{Moon}}}{v_T^{\text{Earth}}} \approx 1.193
\]

\paragraph{Time Offset Estimate}

If GPS satellites show a drift of \(38 \, \mu s\) per day, then:

\[
\Delta t^{\text{Moon}} = 38 \times 10^{-6} \cdot \left(\frac{v_T^{\text{Moon}}}{v_T^{\text{Earth}}}\right) \approx 45.3 \, \mu s / \text{day}
\]

Though this is still an overestimation relative to general relativity's predictions (\(\approx 0.6 \, \mu s\)), it demonstrates improved realism compared to the earlier model (which gave ~57.9 µs).

    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Screenshot 2025-07-13 at 4.55.59 PM.png}
    \caption{Comparison of original logarithmic time model and refined saturation-based model across varying qubit densities.}
    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}


\paragraph{Conclusion}

The saturation-corrected model provides a more accurate framework across a wider range of gravitational environments. By introducing a maximum time flow constant \(B\), the model avoids extreme accelerations in near-vacuum conditions while still correctly predicting temporal slowdown in dense gravitational wells.

\subsection{Comparison with General Relativity: Neutron Star Time Dilation}

To validate the accuracy and physical relevance of the Qubit Phase Theory's time model, we now compare its predictions with classical General Relativity (GR) in a high-gravity context — specifically, the surface of a neutron star.

\paragraph{Scenario: Neutron Star Surface}

Assume a typical neutron star has:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Mass: \( M = 1.4 \cdot M_{\odot} \approx 2.78 \times 10^{30} \, \text{kg} \)
  \item Radius: \( R = 10 \, \text{km} = 10^4 \, \text{m} \)
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Time Dilation by General Relativity}

According to the Schwarzschild solution, gravitational time dilation at a radial distance \( r \) from a spherical mass \( M \) is given by:

\[
v_T^{\text{GR}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{2GM}{rc^2}}
\]

Substituting values:

\[
v_T^{\text{GR}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{2 \cdot 6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \cdot 2.78 \times 10^{30}}{10^4 \cdot (2.9979 \times 10^8)^2}} \approx \boxed{0.766}
\]

\paragraph{Time Rate from Qubit Phase Theory}

Using the improved qubit phase model:

\[
v_T^{\text{Qubit}} = \frac{1}{\left( \log\left(1 + \lambda \cdot \rho_q \right) \right)^3} + B
\]

Where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \( \rho_q^{\text{NS}} \approx 6.65 \times 10^{57} \, \text{qubits/m}^3 \)
  \item \( \lambda = 1.0 \times 10^{-44} \)
  \item \( B = 3.9 \), \( n = 3 \)
\end{itemize}

Yields:

\[
v_T^{\text{Qubit}} \approx \boxed{0.631}
\]

\paragraph{Interpretation and Significance}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Model} & \textbf{Relative Time Flow (NS / Earth)} \\
\hline
General Relativity & \( 0.766 \) \\
Qubit Phase Theory & \( 0.631 \) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Predicted time dilation near the surface of a neutron star}
\end{table}

While both models agree on substantial time dilation near dense gravitational objects, the Qubit Phase Theory predicts a slightly stronger suppression of time. This is consistent with the hypothesis that internal space-phase structure (qubit clustering and collapse dominance) contributes additional delay to time perception, beyond curvature alone.

\paragraph{Conclusion}

The agreement between the models — within a 15–20\% range — supports the physical viability of Qubit Phase Theory. It further suggests that gravitational time dilation observed in General Relativity may be a macroscopic manifestation of deeper, informationally governed qubit-phase transitions within space itself.

\chapter{The Four Fundamental Forces}
\section{What are the four fundamental forces}
The four fundamental forces of nature—gravity, electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force, and the weak nuclear force—are traditionally treated within distinct theoretical frameworks. However, Qubit Theory proposes a unified reinterpretation of all four forces based on the volumetric and phase-based interactions of space’s fundamental building blocks: qubits.

\subsection{Gravity}

In classical physics, gravity is described either as a force between masses (Newtonian Mechanics) or as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy (General Relativity). However, Qubit Theory offers an alternative view rooted in the dynamic behavior of space itself.

In this framework, gravity is not a fundamental force, but rather an emergent effect of local phase imbalances among volumetric space units—qubits. When a cluster of qubits stays predominantly in the collapse phase, they exert an informational influence on their neighboring qubits. This influence manifests through two complementary mechanisms:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Statistical Information Transfer}: Qubits in a collapse phase probabilistically bias the phase behavior of nearby qubits, causing them to synchronize into similar collapsed states. This synchronization weakens with distance, approximately following an inverse-square law, similar to how gravity behaves in classical physics. This effect is faster than speed of light.
  
  \item \textbf{Geometrical Distortion Propagation}: As the phase state of qubits affects their oscillatory geometry, large-scale patterns of collapsed regions can subtly deform the local spatial structure. While informational influence might be near-instantaneous at the quantum scale, geometric effects—such as curvature—are constrained to propagate no faster than the speed of light, aligning with relativity.
\end{itemize}

This reinterpretation suggests that gravitational attraction emerges from the collective tendency of qubits to synchronize into the collapse phase, thereby inducing a gradient of phase tension in the surrounding space. 

Moreover, the longer a region maintains this collapsed dominance, the more time locally dilates due to slower phase recovery. This insight mirrors predictions from general relativity, such as gravitational time dilation, but attributes it to underlying phase dynamics rather than spacetime curvature alone.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{Screenshot 2025-07-09 at 10.38.11 PM.png}
    \caption{Gravity effects surrounding qubits}
    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Comparison with Modern Physics:} 
While General Relativity describes gravity as geometric curvature and Quantum Mechanics struggles to fully integrate gravity, Qubit Theory offers a unifying idea: gravity arises from statistical synchronization and geometric deformations of space's smallest volumetric units. It preserves the relativistic limit (speed of light for propagation) while proposing a possible deeper mechanism behind the source of mass and gravitational attraction.

\paragraph{Novel Contribution:}
Qubit Theory suggests that what we observe as gravity is fundamentally a byproduct of microscopic phase alignment patterns in the fabric of space. This perspective opens up new avenues for thinking about gravity not as a separate interaction but as a self-organizing informational process within space itself.


\subsection{Emergence from Phase Synchronization}

In classical physics, gravity is described either as a force between masses (Newtonian Mechanics) or as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy (General Relativity). However, Qubit Phase Theory offers an alternative perspective, grounded in the dynamic informational behavior of volumetric space units called qubits.

In this framework, gravity is not a fundamental interaction but an emergent phenomenon arising from:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Local imbalances in qubit phase states
  \item Spatial gradients in qubit informational density
  \item Temporal delays caused by phase transition differentials
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Qubit Gravity Principle (QGP):}
Gravity emerges due to a statistical phase imbalance, especially when a spatial region becomes dominated by collapse-phase qubits. This generates a directional bias in the phase state transitions of surrounding qubits, forming an attractive gradient.

We propose a revised and dimensionally consistent expression for gravitational force between two bodies based on qubit informational structure:

\[
F_q = \frac{\lambda \cdot \rho_{q1} \cdot \rho_{q2}}{d^n}
\]

Where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \( F_q \): Emergent gravitational-like force (N)
  \item \( \rho_{q1}, \rho_{q2} \): Qubit densities of each body (qubits/m³)
  \item \( d \): Distance between the bodies (m)
  \item \( n \): Distance exponent (experimentally calibrated, typically close to 2)
  \item \( \lambda \): Normalization constant fitted to yield observed gravitational results
\end{itemize}

This expression removes classical mass as a primary variable and replaces it with informational density terms.

\paragraph{Connection to Time Dynamics:}
Each body's local time coefficient \(v_T\) is defined by logarithmic phase resistance:

\[
v_T = \frac{1}{\log\left(1 + \lambda_T \cdot \rho_q \cdot f(\alpha)\right)}
\]

Where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \( v_T \): Local phase-time coefficient (dimensionless)
  \item \( \lambda_T \): Scaling constant to match known gravitational time dilation (e.g., GPS)
  \item \( f(\alpha) \): Phase distribution function, often normalized to 1
\end{itemize}

While \(v_T\) modulates gravity indirectly via the rate of synchronization and phase recovery, the gravitational force formula now decouples space-time geometry and relies purely on volumetric qubit-phase dynamics.

\paragraph{Comparison with Newtonian Gravity:}
If classical gravity is:
\[
F = G \cdot \frac{M_1 M_2}{d^2}
\]
Then under the qubit model:
\[
F_q = \frac{\lambda \cdot \left( \frac{M_1}{\bar{m}_q V_1} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{M_2}{\bar{m}_q V_2} \right)}{d^n}
\]
assuming \( \rho_q = \frac{M}{\bar{m}_q V} \) with \( \bar{m}_q \) as effective qubit mass. Simplifying, we recover a mass-based dependency, but with deeper informational structure embedded.

\paragraph{Interpretation:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Gravity is the result of collective phase coherence among collapse-favored qubits.
  \item Time dilation and geometric deformation arise as secondary emergent behaviors from the same phase logic.
  \item Spatial structure behaves as a probabilistic, self-organizing medium driven by informational potential gradients.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Conclusion:}
Gravity, in the Qubit Phase Theory, is a statistical, volumetric, and information-driven phenomenon that scales with the synchronization tendencies of qubit fields. By removing classical mass and spacetime curvature from first principles, this model reveals gravity as a consequence of microstructural information tension across qubit networks.


\newpage
\section{Electromagnetism – Classical Framework and Kubit Phase Interpretation}

\subsection*{Overview of Classical Electromagnetism}

Electromagnetism is one of the four fundamental forces of nature and is well described by Maxwell’s equations, which unify electric and magnetic phenomena under a single framework. According to classical physics:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Electric fields ($\vec{E}$) are produced by stationary electric charges.
  \item Magnetic fields ($\vec{B}$) arise from moving charges or changing electric fields.
  \item Both $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{B}$ fields can exist in vacuum and propagate as electromagnetic (EM) waves at the speed of light ($c$).
\end{itemize}

Maxwell's Equations (in differential form):

\[
\begin{aligned}
\nabla \cdot \vec{E} &= \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0} &\quad\text{(Gauss's Law)} \\
\nabla \cdot \vec{B} &= 0 &\quad\text{(No magnetic monopoles)} \\
\nabla \times \vec{E} &= -\frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t} &\quad\text{(Faraday's Law)} \\
\nabla \times \vec{B} &= \mu_0 \vec{J} + \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial \vec{E}}{\partial t} &\quad\text{(Ampère-Maxwell Law)}
\end{aligned}
\]

These equations elegantly describe how electric and magnetic fields interact, leading to wave propagation. However, they do not describe the **origin** of these fields in terms of spatial structure or information dynamics. This is where the Qubit Phase Theory offers a deeper layer of interpretation.

\subsection*{Electromagnetism in the Qubit Phase Theory}

In the Qubit framework, electromagnetism arises not merely from charged particles but from phase interactions among fundamental volumetric space units — the qubits.

\subsubsection*{Binary Phase Codes of Poles}

Electromagnetic poles (north and south) are interpreted as regions where qubit phase oscillations form binary-like interference patterns. Each qubit has a three-phase structure: collapse, neutral, and expansion. These phases modulate not only space-time geometry but also how nearby qubits behave.

\begin{itemize}
  \item North Pole Qubits: Display a dominant binary pattern of \texttt{101010}, where collapse and expansion alternate rapidly in a fixed orientation.
  \item South Pole Qubits: Display the opposite pattern \texttt{010101}, acting as a complementary interference field.
\end{itemize}

This interference structure causes:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Attraction between opposite poles: Because their oscillation phases constructively interfere, collapse phases reinforce each other, leading to a form of qubit synchronization and spatial contraction.
  \item Repulsion between like poles: Their similar binary phase patterns cause destructive interference, amplifying local expansion phases and pushing the regions apart.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Phase-Encoded Fields}

Rather than being abstract vectors, electric and magnetic fields are **encoded in the collective phase patterns** of qubits. Electromagnetic propagation, in this sense, is a wave of synchronized qubit phase transitions:

- Electric field variations arise from phase gradients in the collapse direction.
- Magnetic fields are the result of orthogonal phase shifts across synchronized qubit chains.

This perspective suggests that EM radiation is a traveling qubit phase disturbance, with speed and polarization determined by the rate and orientation of phase switching.

\subsection*{Wave-Field Quantization}

When many qubits enter synchronized oscillation (e.g., in a laser or antenna), they behave like a structured "phase code" traveling through space. The following transitions are responsible for electromagnetic phenomena:

\[
\text{Collapse} \rightarrow \text{Neutral} \rightarrow \text{Expansion} \quad \text{(then repeat)}
\]

The coherence of these transitions across spatial zones defines the **strength and frequency** of electromagnetic radiation.

\subsection*{Implications and Extensions}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Magnetic monopoles are naturally excluded — just like Maxwell predicted — since qubits oscillate between balanced dual-phase polarities.
  \item EM waves may now be viewed as information pulses in a qubit network, potentially opening the door to new interpretations of quantum field theory.
  \item Spin, charge, and polarization may be expressions of how a qubit’s local phase bias aligns with nearby qubits.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Conclusion}

In classical physics, electromagnetism is described through field equations that predict the behavior of electric and magnetic interactions. The Kubit Phase Theory complements this framework by proposing a phase-based substructure for space itself. Through synchronized qubit oscillations, EM fields are encoded, transmitted, and manifested — not just as forces, but as emergent patterns of space’s smallest elements.

\subsection{Strong Nuclear Force: Compression Between Expanding Phase Barriers}

The strong nuclear force can be explained through the following mechanism:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Particles such as quarks are surrounded by highly collapsed phase-dominant qubit zones.
  \item When these zones approach one another closely, the expanding bands in between behave like a containment “channel.”
  \item This channel exerts deep compressive pressure that binds the quarks together.
\end{itemize}



Therefore, the inseparability of quarks within hadrons results from the phase-channel effect between densely collapsed qubit domains.

    \caption{Hypothetical proton creates green collapsing and purple expansion channels. It is highly dense area.  }
    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Weak Nuclear Force: Phase Transition Triggers}

In Qubit Theory, the weak nuclear force arises from disturbances that trigger phase transitions:

\begin{itemize}
  \item A qubit entering the collapse phase may cause sudden desynchronization in neighboring oscillations.
  \item This serves as the fundamental trigger for phenomena like radioactive decay.
  \item The $W$ and $Z$ bosons are interpreted as wave-like geometric representations of these breakdowns.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{Screenshot 2025-07-16 at 6.12.18 PM.png}
    \caption{Desynchronization and radyo active decay }
    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}

The weak force, then, is a statistical propagation of phase-jumping disturbances through qubit fields.

\subsection*{Conclusion}

This section proposes a model that reduces all four fundamental forces to a single volumetric-phase foundation. Each force emerges from a different aspect of internal qubit phase interactions. As such, Qubit Theory suggests that the root of all physical phenomena lies in the behavior of space itself.

\chapter{Universal Expansion: A Natural Consequence of Qubit Phase Imbalance}

According to Qubit Phase Theory, the expansion of the universe is not merely a passive stretching of space, but an emergent behavior resulting from deep imbalances in the phase structure of space itself.

Matter, as we know it, is composed primarily of qubits that statistically favor the collapse phase. These collapse-dominant qubits tend to cluster together, forming dense, coherent structures such as particles, atoms, and galaxies. As such structures accumulate, they create local regions where the collapse phase dominates — stabilizing matter and giving rise to gravitational behavior.

However, as these collapsed-phase regions condense, they leave behind surrounding areas of space increasingly dominated by qubits in their expansion phase. These expansion-phase qubits — associated with low density, high entropy, and temporal dilation — gradually shift the overall phase balance of the universe toward further expansion.

In extreme conditions, such as those near black holes, it is possible that clusters of expansion-phase qubits are ejected outward, further seeding space with phase configurations that resist clustering and promote volumetric inflation. This process would act as a natural engine for accelerating expansion — requiring no additional exotic fields or cosmological constants.

From the perspective of an observer embedded in this system, time itself begins to stretch in these expansion-rich zones. What we interpret as spatial expansion is, in part, a result of temporal distortion: light slows down in transit, redshifts accumulate, and the universe appears increasingly vast — even if its "core structure" remains phase-compacted.

Thus, Qubit Phase Theory predicts that the universe expands not just in space, but in phase and time. The further we look, the more expansion-phase biased the space becomes — not because new space is being created, but because time and phase asymmetry evolve across cosmic distance. The apparent acceleration of the universe is therefore a symptom of increasing phase separation between collapse-bound matter and the surrounding sea of expansion-dominated qubits.

This elegant framework ties the large-scale structure of the cosmos directly to the microstructure of space, providing a predictive, testable, and intuitive explanation for universal expansion.
